<h1>Project 2 - Checkpoint 1</h1>
<h4>What was the theme you chose?</h4>
<p> After weeks on end of struggling, I've finally gotten something. The theme of my project is Never Give Up! I Feel this way because I contemplated on numerous occasions just giving up and trying harder on the next project but I perservered. <br>
<h4>What are at least 3 issues you encountered with your project? How did you fix them?</h4>
<p>1. I followed the powerpoint slides to create the project and the powerpoint slides didn't get me very far.<br>
<p>2. Trying to push to heroku was a STRUGGLE! To fix my deployment issue, I had to update my requirements file. I learned this from project 1.<br>
<p>3. I wasn't sure how about the final layout. My app doesn't really resemble a chat room but I guess there is always room for improvement.<br>
<h4>What are known problems, if any, with your project?</h4>
<p>1. There is no database.<br>
<p>2. To create a hack for not having a database, I wanted to display the console log messages to the html page but I couldn't figure that out either.<br>
<h4>What would you do to improve your project in the future?</h4>
<p>I want to update the styling -- I really didn't style much.<br>
<p>I want to add the database.<br>
